# simplesearch

Poof of concept command line tool to generate file and inverted word lists useful for naive search implementations.

[ws](https://github.com/rsdoiel/ws) is a simple static site web server for development. It data mockup with an embedded
JavaScript engine called [otto](https://github.com/robertkrimen/otto). In theory you should be able to write
a simple search API using a pre-caculated inverted word list and simple look up via a data structure in JavaScript.

Another use case would be to implement simple site search with a dynamic language like PHP without resorting to a
database for persistence.
